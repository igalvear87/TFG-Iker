# TFG

This repository contains the source code for my final project in the Physics degree at the **University of Barcelona** (2025).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The goal of this project is to simulate and analyze the **collective behavior of fish** using computational methods. The study explores how individual interaction rules lead to emergent group dynamics, a phenomenon common in many biological systems.

The code is written in **Fortran90**, and it models simplified agents (fish) in a two-dimensional space. By adjusting parameters such as alignment, separation, and cohesion, we can observe how schools of fish self-organize and evolve over time.

## ðŸ§ª Academic Context

- **Degree**: Bachelor's Degree in Physics  
- **Institution**: University of Barcelona  
- **Year**: 2025  
- **Topic**: Collective behavior in biological systems  
- **Language**: Fortran90  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the simulation:

1. Compile the Fortran code using your preferred compiler (e.g. `gfortran`).
